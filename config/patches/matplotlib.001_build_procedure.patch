+# Matplotlib supports multiple GUI toolkits, including Cocoa,
+# GTK, Fltk, MacOSX, Qt, Qt4, Tk, and WX. Support for many of
+# these toolkits requires AGG, the Anti-Grain Geometry library,
+# which is provided by matplotlib and built by default.
+#
+# Some backends are written in pure Python, and others require
+# extension code to be compiled. By default, matplotlib checks for
+# these GUI toolkits during installation and, if present, compiles the
+# required extensions to support the toolkit.
+#
+# - GTK 2.x support of any kind requires the GTK runtime environment
+#   headers and PyGTK.
+# - Tk support requires Tk development headers and Tkinter.
+# - Mac OSX backend requires the Cocoa headers included with XCode.
+# - Windowing is MS-Windows specific, and requires the "windows.h"
+#   header.
+#
+# The other GUI toolkits do not require any extension code, and can be
+# used as long as the libraries are installed on your system --
+# therefore they are installed unconditionally.
+#
+# You can uncomment any the following lines to change this
+# behavior. Acceptible values are:
+#
+#     True: build the extension. Exits with a warning if the
+#           required dependencies are not available
+#     False: do not build the extension
+#     auto: build if the required dependencies are available,
+#           otherwise skip silently. This is the default
+#           behavior
