# - Find PThread
# This module finds an installed PThread using the variable PTHREAD_ROOT_DIR 
# as a lookup path.
# It sets the following variables:
#  PTHREAD_FOUND       - set to true if PThread is found
#  PTHREAD_INCLUDE_DIR - the directory where the include files are located
#  PTHREAD_LIBRARIES   - the path to PThread library
#
# The file "pthread.h" is looked for PTHREAD_INCLUDE_DIR.
# Libraries are searched with following names: 
#    pthread
# On Win32:
#    pthreadVC2
# or in Debug mode:
#    pthreadVC2d
