# KERNEL detection for salome - this is typically called by dependent modules
# (GUI, PARAVIS, etc ...)
#
# The detection is simpler than for other prerequisites.
# Indeed calling SALOME_FIND_PACKAGE_AND_DETECT_CONFLICTS() with SalomeKERNEL is tricky:
#  - one would write  SALOME_FIND_PACKAGE_AND_DETECT_CONFLICTS(KERNEL xyz n)
#  - then the macro would look first for a file named SalomeKERNELConfig.cmake (=the normal situation)
#  - if not found (because KERNEL_ROOT_DIR was badly set for example) the macro would then look
# for a file named FindSalomeKERNEL.cmake
#  => this is the current file, and that would trigger an infinite recursion ... :-)
#  This could be detected with a flag mechanism, but honestly this becomes an overkill.
#
# So we go for a simple lookup, without conflict check:
#
